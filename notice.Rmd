### Data presentation

The goal is to present the data credit cards by 

* dimension
* name of variables
* and some statistics.


###Description of SVM

Here, we have an example of support vector machine with a little sample.
you can select your choice into the type of kernel :

* _linear_
* _polynomial_
* _radial basis_
* _sigmoid_

and after choosing parameters which you need, you have to push the button submit to display the results.

###SVM

In this section you can observe the application of support vector machine into the sample
It's possible to change parameters in default and submit after.  
You can choice : 

1. __the kernel : __

You can select into : 
* _linear_
* _polynomial_
* _radial basis_
* _sigmoid_

2. __degree : __

You can enter the number or choose it with the arrows.

3. __b : __

You can enter the number or choose it with the arrows.

4. __C : __

You can choose C by moving the cursor.


###comparison

It's to compare the support vector machine with others models one at a time.  
You can select the type of model :

* _logistic regression_
* _linear discriminant analysis_
* _quadratic discriminant analysis_

We observe the contingency table and the percent of good predections of the choosen model.
At the final we have the comparison of the percent of good prediction with the SVM model chooses compare to the percent of good prediction with the model selected.

The conclusion of this app is :
